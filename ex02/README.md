The objective of this exercise is to learn how to create classes in objective-c and use basic mutable collections.

# Steps #
1.  Create a new console application in XCode.
2.  Create a Fibonacci class that will implement the Fibonacci formula.
3.  Implement the Fibonacci sequence - create the following method in the Fibonacci class
`- (int)calculate:(int)i;`
4.  Speed up the algorythm to be able to calculate for i=100 in less than 1s;
5.  Use primitive types that handle bigger numbers.
